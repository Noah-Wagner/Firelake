## What is it?
A platform of some sorts that encourages girls to get into Computer Science.  The kit would come with programming challenges of increasing difficulty, which would plant programming seeds.  The goal of the kit would not be to get girls to a developer level, but rather get girls comfortable looking at code and with basic concepts.  It should output on jewelry.

## For who?
Girls aged 8 - 14.
